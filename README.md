# Frequentist_Inference_Case-Study---Parts-A-B
In this case study, you’ll learn more about frequentist inference. There are two parts to the case study. In part A, you’ll learn the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. In Part B, you’ll apply those implementations to a real-world scenario
